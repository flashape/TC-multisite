Customize the author slug in the permalink for author pages.

== Description ==

This plugin gives you full control over the permalinks for author pages. When using "pretty permalinks", by default URLs to author pages are structured:

http://www.example.com/author/author-name/

With this plugin you can change the "author" part of these URLs into anything you like, for example:

http://www.example.com/editorial/author-name/ 
http://www.example.com/crew/author-name/ 
http://www.example.com/members/author-name/
http://www.example.com/posts-by/author-name/

The plugin will also automatically change links throughout your site that point to author pages. The URLs of author feeds are also changed.
