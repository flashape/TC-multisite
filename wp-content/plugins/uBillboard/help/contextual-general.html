<h3>General Options</h3>
<p>These options apply to all uBillboard instances on this particular WordPress site.</p>
<dl>
	<dt>JavaScript Compression</dt>
	<dd>Check if you want to use the compressed version of uBillboard.js on the frontend. This is the default
	setting. Uncheck only if you have made changes to the uncompressed version of the JS and don't want to
	recompress it yet. Otherwise you should always use the compressed version. It is much smaller and will
	help your site load faster.</dd>
	
	<dt>Shortcode Optimization</dt>
	<dd>This option, if checked, will optimize uBillboard asset loading by intelligently detecting if uBillboard
	shortcode is used on the page that is currently being loaded, and loading the assets accordingly. So in most
	common case, when you use uBillboard only on the front page, it will shave of around 50KB off every page that
	does not have uBillboard. This can increase your page load time on those pages. On the other hand, you should
	only apply this option if you are using shortcodes as the only way of including uBillboard into your page. 
	Checking this option while using a PHP function in the code to load uBillboard <em>will</em> break it on that 
	page.</dd>
