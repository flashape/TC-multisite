				<h2>About uBillboard</h2>
				<p>Thank you for purchasing uBillboard! Your continued support helps us maintain this product.
				So roughly on its first birthday we're coming with the third major revision!</p>
				<p>uBillboard was one of the first Slider/Billboard-type Premium Plugins for WordPress on 
				CodeCanyon. It enjoys continued popularity for nearly a year now, mainly because of the ease
				of use and feature set, that is wide and yet does not ovewhelm you, like some other products,
				with options you'll never need. Our featureset is based on what our users have been really 
				requesting over the course of uBillboard's lifetime.</p>

				<p>Most of the possible issues will be covered this doc, or you can take a look

				you believe that you've found a bug, feel free to contact us.</p>

			<div id="installation" class="section">
				<h2>Installation</h2>
				<p>uBillboard installation should be pretty straightforward. You have downloaded a ZIP file containing 
				this help and another ZIP file, called uBillboard.zip. We will assume you have WordPress installed
				already (if not, read <ha ref="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress">here</a>).</p>
				<ol>
					<li>In your	WordPress Admin go to Plugins &gt; Add New &gt; Upload</li>
					<li>Select uBillboard.zip and press Install Now</li>
					<li>If it is not already, go to Plugins and press Activate on the uBillboard line</li>
				</ol>
				<p>After installation you may want to check if the cache folder has the right permissions. To do that
				open your WordPress installation using your FTP program and go to wp-content/plugins/uBillboard. Check
				if the permissions on the cache directory are sufficient (777, or 755 on some hosts)</p>
			</div>
			
			<div id="usage" class="section">
				<h2>Usage</h2>
				<p>In this section we will discuss how to create and display your uBillboards.</p>
				<p>The envisioned mode of operation is that you go to uBillboard &gt; Add New, create your
				billboard and then just add the corresponding shortcode in the Page or Post of your liking. We've
				done maximum to simplify this process for you.</p>
				<p>When you first open the Add New page in the uBillboard menu, you will be presented with a line,
				already containing an unique name for your new Billboard, a box that represents the first slide, 
				and some more boxes on the right hand side for options.</p>
				
				<h3>Adding, deleting and moving Slides</h3>
				<p>The box named Slide 1 contains the settings for the first individual slide. You can add, delete
				and move around any of these boxes by clicking the corresponding button in the handle of the box,
				clicking the button at the bottom of the box list called "Add New Slide", you can move boxes by
				dragging them by the handle, or using the Slide Order box on the right side. If you use the button
				in the slide handle, a new Slide will be added after the current one. If you use the Add New Slide
				button at the bottom, a new slide will be added at the end of the list.</p>
				<p>In order to delete a slide you can press the delete button on the handle, that will delete the
				corresponding slide.</p>
				
				<h3>Uploading Images</h3>
				<p>uBillboard uses WordPress' Media Library images. In order to add your images to uBillboard, you
				need to have them loaded in the Media Library. Once all of your images are loaded, they will 
				display in the dialog that opens when you click on the small image icon in the Image URL field.</p>
				<p>Once that is open you can select any image from your Media Library by clicking on it.</p>
				
				<h3>Other Options</h3>
				<p>All of the other options are pretty straightforward and the documentation is available in the
				help drawer at the top right side of every Admin Page.</p>

			<div id="extending" class="section">
				<h2>Extending</h2>
				<p>We've been including the option to extend uBillboard since the early days. In uBillboard v3,
				thanks to the vast architectural changes, we're able to simplify the multitude of filters and 
				actions into just one, with the same possibilities.</p>
				<p>The filter in uBillboard v3 is called 'uds_billboard_render_before', it gives you the ability
				to change the uBillboard object before it is rendered. That means that you can change every 
				aspect of the uBillboard or any slide, you can add, remove, move any slide you wish.</p>
				<p>You can add your own filter like so:</p>
				<code>add_filter('uds_billboard_render_before', 'my_handler');</code>
				<p>where my_handler() is your function that will receive uBillboard object as the sole parameter
				and is expected to return a uBillboard object that will be rendered.</p>
				<h3>Examples</h3>
				<p>To change the width of every uBillboard you can do this:</p>
				<pre>
add_filter('uds_billboard_render_before', 'my_handler');
function my_handler($billboard) {
	$billboard->width = 300;
	return $billboard;
}
				</pre>
				
				<p>To change the width of uBillboard named 'billboard' you can do this:</p>
				<pre>
add_filter('uds_billboard_render_before', 'my_handler');
function my_handler($billboard) {
	if($billboard->name == 'billboard') {
		$billboard->width = 300;
	}
	return $billboard;
}
				</pre>
			</div>
			
			<div id="faq" class="section">
				<h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
				<dl>
					<dt>My uBillboard is not displaying, or is showing the shortcode only</dt>
					<dd>If you are using shortcodes, try calling them with or without the quotes. If your uBillboard
					name is 'billboard' try using the shortcode <code>[uds-billboard name=billboard]</code> OR
					<code>[uds-billboard name="billboard"]</code> as this can help in certain situations.</dd>
					
					<dt>My uBillboard is not loading</dt>
					<dd>Make sure you have the correct permissions set for your Cache folder, alternatively try
					turning off the Automatic Image Resizing. If uBillboard stops loading at the end of the progress
					bar, check JavaScript errors on your page.</dd>
					
					<dt>My images are not loading</dt>
					<dd>If your images, or thumbs are not loading, try unchecking the Use Relative Paths option on
					the Background tab. That might help on some occasions</dd>
