<h3>Add/Edit a uBillboard</h3>
<p>Here you can create new, or edit existing uBillboards. We will go through the options on this page:</p>
<h4>uBillboard Options</h4>
<dl>
	<dt>Title</dt>
	<dd>Allows you to assing a name for your uBillboard, in case you have multiple. It is recommended to use the default name though.</dd>
	
	<dt>Options - Preview</dt>
	<dd>Allows you to preview the billboard. Will save your changes into a temporary billboard, so you need to make sure you save your
	changes using the "Save uBillboard" button. This preview also does not necessarily have to look exactly the same as in the frontend.
	This is because Preview does not load your theme's CSS, and therefore it will not reflect on this previewed uBillboard.</dd>
	
	<dt>Options - Width</dt>
	<dd>Specifies uBillboard width in pixels. This width represents the width of the actual stage area, where all the slides are. If you have
	either thumbnails or controls set to "outside", the actual total space taken by uBillboard will be more. If "Apply Automatic Resizing"
	is enabled, images will be resized to fit this width.</dd>
	
	<dt>Options - Height</dt>
	<dd>Specifies uBillboard height in pixels, generally the same rules apply as to Width.</dd>
	
	<dt>Options - Shuffle Slides</dt>
	<dd>Will randomize the order in which slides appear on each page load.</dd>
	
	<dt>Options - Autoplay</dt>
	<dd>Will automatically start playing once all slides have been loaded.</dd>
	
	<dt>Options - Square Size</dt>
	<dd>Some of the animations are based around relatively small squares that are animated separately to achieve beautiful transition.
	You can control the dimension (in pixels) of these squares using this option. Please note: The smaller the dimension, the smaller the squares.
	The smaller the squares, the more of them are needed to fill the uBillboard space. Too many squares can cause performance issues,
	general rule of thumb with this option is to keep it on a value that, given your uBillboard Width and Height will generate 50 - 100
	squares. [50 &gt; (width / square size) * (height / square size) &gt; 100]</dd>
	
	<dt>Options - Style</dt>
	<dd>Optional, it is the default style for your content boxes with slide descriptions if you have any. These can be then overriden
	with the per-description box options in the Content Editor</dd>
	
	<dt>Options - Delete</dt>
	<dd>Deletes this uBillboard. Not undoable.</dd>
	
	<dt>Options - Save uBillboard</dt>
	<dd>Saves uBillboard overwriting any uBillboards with the same name.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Slide Order</h4>
<dl>
	<dt>Slide Order</dt>
	<dd>Each box represents a slide. Drag them around, when you drop, slides on the left will be automatically moved/renamed. You still
	need to save uBillboard for the changes to take effect on the frontend.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Controls</h4>
<dl>
	<dt>Show Timer</dt>
	<dd>Will show a countdown circle in the top right corner of the slide that will show the time remaining before the next slide is
	shown. This will not appear if you don't have Autoplay enabled or don't press Play. This feature is not supported on browsers 
	that don't support Canvas - that is the IE.</dd>
	
	<dt>Controls Skin</dt>
	<dd>Allows you to choose the skin you want to use with your uBillboard instance. There is a variety of skins with different
	controls layouts and behaviors as well as look &amp; feel</dd>
	
	<dt>Controls Position</dt>
	<dd>Controls can be positioned either inside of the uBillboard bounds defined by Width and Height options, or outside. Generally
	where exactly are they positioned is controlled by the Controls Skin, but you can decide if you want them covering your content.
	The controls position is useful when your controls overlap with Thumbnails. In that case you can position either the controls,
	or thumbnails outside or inside so that the two don't overlap.</dd>
	
	<dt>Show Controls</dt>
	<dd>This option controls the display of Next/Prev buttons. You can either show them at all times, on mouse hover over uBillboard,
	or never.</dd>
	
	<dt>Show Play/Pause</dt>
	<dd>Similar to "Show Controls", but controls the Play/Pause button.</dd>
	
	<dt>Show Paginator</dt>
	<dd>Similar to "Show Controls" and "Show Play/Pause", but controls the paginator. Paginator is most of the time displayed as
	bullets that each represent the corresponding slide, but in some skins in can take other forms.</dd>
	
	<dt>Show Thumbnails</dt>
	<dd>Similar to "Show Controls" etc. Thumbnails are small images that represent the content of the slide they point to. When
	you click a thumbnail, you will be taken to the corresponding slide.</dd>
	
	<dt>Thumbnails Position</dt>
	<dd>Thumbnails can be positioned on all four edges of uBillboard.</dd>
	
	<dt>Thumbnails Inside</dt>
	<dd>Similar to Controls Position, thumbnails can be positioned inside or outside.</dd>
	
	<dt>Thumbnail Width</dt>
	<dd>Width if the thumbnail image in pixels</dd>
	
	<dt>Thumbnail Height</dt>
	<dd>Height if the thumbnail image in pixels</dd>
	
	<dt>Thumbnail Hover Color</dt>
	<dd>The border color of each thumbnail</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Slide Options</h4>
<dl>
	<dt>Background Image URL</dt>
	<dd>The main field. You should almost always have an image for your slide. You can select from all images in your Media Library.
	A preview will be displayed on the left hand side of the slide edit box.</dd>
	
	<dt>Apply Automatic Resizing</dt>
	<dd>Uses <a href="http://code.google.com/p/timthumb/">TimThumb</a> to automatically resize your image to the dimensions of 
	uBillboard. This feature can be problematic on some servers, if it does not work for you, see the link above, make sure your
	cache folder is writable, and if all else fails feel free to contact us.</dd>
	
	<dt>Use Relative Paths</dt>
	<dd>Will call TimThumb using a relative path to the image specified above instead of an absolute path. On some servers it helps 
	to turn this off. In particular, we've had that experience on a Windows server. But it should only be necessary if TimThumb isn't
	working for you.</dd>
	
	<dt>Background Color</dt>
	<dd>Fallback background color for the slide, in case you have transparent images or videos in your slide.</dd>
	
	<dt>Transparent Background</dt>
	<dd>Related to the above, but since you can not use color picker to select a transparent color, we have this checkbox.</dd>
	
	<dt>Content Type</dt>
	<dd>Allows you to add additional content overlay on top of your slide. You can select:
		<ul>
			<li>No Content - just the image</li>
			<li>Content Editor - Special feature that allows you to add text to your slide, discussed below</li>
			<li>Embedded Content - allows you to embed YouTube or Vimeo video</li>
			<li>Blog-based Dynamic Content - allows you to link your slide to the Blog</li>
		</ul>
	</dd>
	
	<dt>No Content</dt>
	<dd>Only the image will be displayed.</dd>
	
	<dt>Content Editor</dt>
	<dd>Content editor allows you to visually position multiple boxes with content (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language)">
	Textile</a> or plain HTML) on top of your slide.</dd>
	
	<dt>Text Evaluation</dt>
	<dd>Decides how will the content of the boxes in the Content Editor be treated.</dd>
	
	<dt>Embedded Content</dt>
	<dd>Specify the URL of the content you want to embed and we'll take care of the rest.</dd>
	
	<dt>Blog-based Content</dt>
	<dd>Will pull content from the Blog. Content will be displayed on top of the slide, if Featured image is available, it will be used
	instead of the image specified in "Background Image".</dd>
	
	<dt>Blog Offset</dt>
	<dd>Blog entries are sorted from the most recent to the least recent. Offset specifies which article to use. Offset of 0 means
	that the most recent article will be used. Offset of 1 means that the second most recent aricle will be used.</dd>
	
	<dt>Link URL</dt>
	<dd>The whole uBillboard can be wired to open a specific link. If you specify a link here, it will be used when this slide
	is currently being shown and the user clicks on an area of uBillboard that does not trigger another functionality (like
	go to Next page or similar).</dd>
	
	<dt>Transition Delay:</dt>
	<dd>If Autoplay is active or the user has started the playback manually, this value will determine how much time will pass before
	the next slide is animated in.</dd>
	
	<dt>Transition:</dt>
	<dd>Allows you to select an effect that will be applied when switching from the next slide</dd>
	
	<dt>Transition Direction:</dt>
	<dd>The mode of application of the transition effect. The combination of these two settings determines how will the transition look.
	There are some combinations that don't make sense and therefore are not implemented. These will fall back to a default transition
	direction for the selected transition.</dd>
