<h3>uBillboard Import/Export</h3>
<p>You can Import/Export your uBillboards on this page.</p>

<h4>Export</h4>
<p>Export will enable you to download an XML with all your uBillboards exported. This XML can only be imported
by uBillboard version 3.</p>

<h4>Import</h4>
<p>Import has two sections: Import from v2.x and Import from 3.x</p>
<p>Import from version 2.x is only an upgrade. You can not use v2 exported uBillboards. If uBillboard 3 finds
uBillboard v2.x data in the database, it will offer you the option to upgrade automatically. Please note that
uBillboards from the upgrade will overwrite any existing ubillboards with the same names!</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer:</em> given that uBillboard 3 is radically different from v2, the upgrade will do everything
in its power to restore your original layout, functionality and transitions, but sometimes that just isn't
possible. In those cases uBillboard 3 importer will try to either simulate your original settings or strait
out sets the default value. It is because of this that it is <strong>strongly</strong> recommended to check
your uBillboard after the upgrade and make the changes as necessary.</p>

<p>Import from v3 is pretty straightforward. Just upload the export file and click import. Check Import 
Attachments if you want to try and import the original images from the original site.</p>
