A simple search for find strings in your database and replace the string. You can search in ID, post-content, GUID, titel, excerpt, meta-data, comments, comment-author, comment-e-mail, comment-url, tags/categories and categories-description. It is possible to replace the user-ID in all tables and the user-login for more security in the WordPress-Application ( [more Informations](http://wordpress-buch.bueltge.de/wordpress-sicherer-machen/30/ "about Security in WordPress") ).
