Q: How do I create a table ?
A: In order to create datatable you need your data as a CSV file. If you have created your table in e.g. Microsoft Excel then you need to export it as CSV (Comma-delimited). 

If you prefer to use a program like NotePad to create a text file, the same list would look something like this.
